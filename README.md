# sample-webboot

This is a prototype for integrating a Spring-based Swing application with Spring Boot web application. Some of the goals/questions explored:

1. Spring Boot API for bootstrapping and custom application initialization
2. Can a thick client Swing application coexist with Spring Boot web application container?
3. Can both Swing and Web application context share beans?
